Peer-graded Assessment: Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course Project

This README file contains simple, essential information about the Course Project. 

Data were downloaded sourcing the c3_w4_ProgAss_Get_Data.R script. 

The 5 steps indicated by the instructions, as well as the commands for producing the final data set, are in the run_analysis.R script (also called "main script"). 

The main script is heavily commented, so that each step is succinctly yet --hopefully-- clearly explained. 

The CODEBOOK Markdown file contains additional information to illustrate the data sets and the data manipulations performed. 

To read the final tidy data set I produced, adpat the command: 

data <- read.table("c3_w4_FinalTidyData", header = TRUE)
